## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd SheCare-AI
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

- **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in `backend/app/` with:
  ```env
  DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
  SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
  ```
- **Database**: The app uses SQLite by default. The database file is `backend/shecare.db`.
- **Run the Backend**:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  python -m uvicorn app.app:app --reload
  ```
  The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
- The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Make sure the backend is running for full functionality.

## Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_TYPE`: Database backend (default: sqlite)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret for JWT signing (keep this private!)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key for chatbot (keep this private!)

## Authentication
- JWT tokens are used for all protected endpoints.
- The frontend stores the token in `localStorage` as `token`.
- All API requests to protected endpoints must include:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```

## API Endpoints (Key)
- `POST /auth/signup` â€” Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` â€” Login and receive JWT token
- `GET /dashboard` â€” Get user dashboard data
- `POST /cycle-tracker` â€” Add a cycle entry
- `GET /cycle-tracker` â€” List cycle entries
- `POST /journal` â€” Add a journal entry
- `GET /journal` â€” List journal entries
- `POST /pcos-checker` â€” Submit PCOS check
- `GET /pcos-checker` â€” List PCOS checks
- `GET /recommendations` â€” Get personalized recommendations
- `POST /chatbot` â€” Ask the AI chatbot a question

## Recommendations Logic
- Cycle, mood, symptoms, hydration, engagement, and PCOS data are analyzed.
- Only one cycle-related recommendation is shown at a time (short, long, irregular, or normal).
- All recommendations use emoji at the start for clarity and engagement.
- Example recommendations:
  - ðŸ©º Your cycles are shorter than average. Consider consulting a gynecologist.
  - ðŸ˜´ You've mentioned tiredness or sleep. Prioritize rest and good sleep hygiene for better well-being.
  - ðŸ§¬ Maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and consult a gynecologist if concerned.

## Chatbot Integration
- Uses Google Gemini via `google-generativeai` SDK.
- Loads API key from `.env`.
- Provides context-aware answers using recent user data (cycles, moods, journals).
- Always returns plain text responses.

## Troubleshooting
- **401 Unauthorized**: Log out and log in again to get a fresh token. Ensure the token uses the `sub` field for user ID.
- **Failed to get AI response**: Check backend logs for errors, ensure the Google API key is valid, and the token is sent in the Authorization header.
- **Database issues**: Delete `shecare.db` and restart the backend to reset data (for development only).
- **CORS errors**: The backend enables CORS for all origins by default.
